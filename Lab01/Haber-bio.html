    Hi,I am Samie Haber, and I am currently majoring in Information Management and Technology with a minor in Sport Management. I love using photoshop and adobe illustrator to create new designs and also have a Redbubble account to display my work. I enjoy listening to pop and EDM music, hang out with my friends, and go to the gym. Some of my favorite shows include Friends, Gossip Girl, and One Tree Hill. I have two dogs named Gus and Kenzie, and I always like to play or cuddle up with them
