    <p class="description"> Roger Federer was born August 8th,1981 in Basel, Switzerland. He dominated the sport in the 
            early 21st century with his outstanding all-around game. Federer won a record of 8 Wimbledon titles, 
            and in 2018 became the first player to win 20 Grand Slam mens singles championships. Ever since 
            Federer was a young boy, he had a love for tennis. He started playing for the first time at the age of 
            eight and became Switzerlands junior champion when he was 14, and in 1998, he won the boys singles 
            final at Wimbledon. The following year, Federer finally made his first debut in the ATP playing on the 
            Swiss Davis Cup team. This is where he became the youngest tennis player to end the year in the worlds 
            top 100, finishing as number 64. Many fans and pros saw the potential in Federer and knew there was 
            only one way to go from here, which was all the way up to number one. In 2001, he was able to use his 
            talent to beat Pete Sampras who was ranked number 10 in the world at the time. After this match, by 
            the end of 2002, Federer reached his way into the top 10 and was ranked number 6 in the world. In 
            2003, Federer won his first Grand Slam ever at Wimbledon and the following year he gained his first 
            Australian Open as well as U.S. Open. This made him known for becoming the first player to win the two 
            tournaments three years in a row. Even though Federer was gaining all this fame at such a young age, he 
            became known for his sportsmanship and composure. People even started calling him “the maestro” as 
            he had such a charm and grace to him while winning so many matches and tournaments. In 2004, 
            Federer won 11 of the 17 tournaments he played in and finished the year ranked number one in the 
            world. While Federer dominated the 2000s, his career started to derail in 2016 as he suffered from
            many injuries. Even though he had some obstacles to overcome throughout his career, he has steadily 
            led the way alongside Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal as being part of the “Big 3” for two decades. He 
            just announced his retirement at the age of 41 and is known as one of the greatest tennis players of all 
            time.</p>
