        <p class=found><strong> Foundations: </strong>  Federer first started his own charitable foundation called the “Roger Federer Foundation” 
        to provide sports and education to children in places that have little or no funding at all. This foundation 
        is a charitable grant making foundation, that supports innovative projects operated by local relief 
        organizations in selected countries throughout the world. Federers foundation currently has funds of 
        $1,243,182. In addition, he has supported many charities such as Elton John AIDS Foundation, Humpty 
        Dumpty Foundation, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and many more.</p><br>

        shoes and athletic wear up until their contract expired in 2018. After that, he signed a deal with Uniqlo, 
        which would be who Federers new sponsor on the court. In May 2020, Federer became the first tennis 
        player to reach the top of Forbes list of highest paid athletes in the world and was soon endorsed by
