    <p class="paragraph"> Roger Federer has been out of the game since Wimbledon of last year due to his third knee surgery in 18 
        months. His career has been on pause since July due to the set back with his knee injury, which also kept 
        him out of the 2020 season after the Australian Open. Even though he has been out the game for a 
        while, he has been preparing to make a comeback at the Laver Cup this year. Unfortunately, this will be 
        Federers last tournament ever as he just announced his retirement. However, through his composure 
        and grace throughout the game and the many precedents he set Roger Federer will always be known as
        the greatest of all time and will never be forgotten throughout tennis history.</p>
